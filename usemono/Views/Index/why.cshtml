	    <h3>Why Should I Think About Mono?</h3>
	    <p>So if Mono compatibility is so good, why should I have to think about Mono compatibility when I'm developing?</p>
	    <p>Well, <a href="http://mono-project.com/Compatibility">compatibility is great</a>, but it's not perfect. Many open source projects that use C# ignore
	    Mono completely and set up build processes incompatible with Unix/Mono users or use parts of .NET that Mono does not yet support. This means a smaller
	    pool of potential contributers (or at least a larger barrier to contribution) and limits the size of the .NET Open Source Community.</p>
		<p>In list format:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You run an open source project and want as large a pool of contributers as possible.</li>
            <li>You want as large a pool of users as possible.</li>
            <li>You are making a website or service and want to run it on Linux.</li>
            <li>You want to make use of Linux-based cloud offerings like Heroku.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>...But Linux is hard!</h4>
        <p>Linux is certainly a different environment for a Window developer. However the packaging environment of linux is much richer. 
            Usually, Windows developers have a hard time on a non-gui solution. However, once you get the hang of it; the command shell of linux can be a powerful one.
            In this day, and age of configuration management, you should not have to do manual tasks on a server. 
        Learn how to work in a different environment, and ultimately you may learn tricks to bring back to the Windows world.

    	<h3>Mono Myths</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
	    		Mono has poor compatibility with .NET:<br/>
	    		<p>False. Mono has surprisingly-good compatibility with the .NET framework. <a href="http://mono-project.com/Compatibility">At a high level</a>, Mono doesn't support WCF and has limited support for the 4.5 TPL.
	    		There is also a <a href="http://go-mono.com/status/">Mono Class Status Page</a> that provides compatibility breakdowns at the assmebly level, all the way down to the class level. A quick
	    		click through the list shows just how much of the framework is implemented.
	    		</p>
    		</li>
			<li>
				It's difficult to test my application for Mono compatibility:<br/>
				<p>False. Mono provides an analysis library called <a href="http://mono-project.com/Gendarme">Gendarme</a> that allows developers to easily test their assemblies for Mono compatibility (as well as other best practices).
				So, as a basic test, a developer can run the application through Gendarme to test for basic compatibility without even having Mono installed or a Linux box to test it on.</p>
				<p>For a more complete test, the advent of cheap development environments through <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> or <a href="http://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>
				affords the developer an opportunity to test applications for Mono compatibility during development, or as part of automated integration testing.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				It's difficult to install a recent version of Mono:<br/>
				<p>Mostly false. Granted, most larger Linux distros provide wildly-out-of-date versions of mono from their default repositories. Ubuntu users can choose from several PPAs, such as
				<a href="https://launchpad.net/~ermshiperete/+archive/ubuntu/monodevelop">ermshiperete/monodevelop</a>. Fedora, CentOS, or Debian users can find a repository on the <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/download/package?project=home:tpokorra:mono&package=monodevelop-opt">OpenSuSE Build System</a>.</p>
				<p>Additionally, this Puppet module will install a modern version of Mono on pretty much any OS. TODO: Open source and link Module</p>
